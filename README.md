## Software Engineer


Full-stack engineer. Experienced with Javascript, Typescript, React, Angular, Node, Express, Koa, Mongo, and SQL. 

I also have experience with VBA. It was the first language I learned and the one that started everything.

- :earth_americas: I am based in Washington, DC
- :rocket: I’m currently working on Huddler in a team of six developers.
- 🌱 In my free time I am honing my skills in Angular and Next.js. Afterwards, I would love to learn React Native.
